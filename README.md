# Live Image Processing Blog

*by Guillermo Montecinos, NYU ITP Spring 2019*

This document and the contents stored in this repo corresponds to the class [Live Image Processing](https://itp.nyu.edu/classes/lipp/) taught by Matt Romein, at NYU ITP during the 2019 Spring term.

## Week 2
For the second class we were committed to make different kind video footages in order to have a diversity of moving images to use as resource for video processing. I decided to explore different materials that would bring me diverse textures, colors and depth levels, most of them available indoors as water and plants. In terms of technical stuff I made the footage in an horizontal orientation and converted half of the videos using Adobe Premiere and ffmpeg â€“using the command `ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v prores -an output.mov`

For example I felt curious of recording the movement of bubbles in a boiling glass made water kettle so I took a shoot of the floor's kitchen kettle which also has a funny blue light. As well, I attempted to explore light reflection through a glass of water and the shapes light can make over a surface.

On the other hand I explored materials as lumber, synthetic grass and leaves of plants that I found in the floor shelves. Something interesting happened in the last one because they are lightened with a ultraviolet set of LEDs which a particular wave length that made a weird interference when I recorded it.
